Password Generator window as it appears on macOS (for some as yet unknown reason the radio buttons do not appear evenly spaced on macOS but fine on Windows 10)

Please feel free to use/modify to your hearts content. The code is not the prettiest or the best and I in no way claim to be a programmer (It's just a hobby). If you think you can improve it, please go ahead.
